Features:

Leverages pre-trained BERT for sentiment analysis
Evaluates model with accuracy and F1 metrics
Visualizes token relationships with BertViz

Requirements:

transformers: provides pre-trained models for NLP
datasets: for loading ready-to-use datasets
bertviz: for visualizing word connections in each BERT layer
seaborn: for data visualization
